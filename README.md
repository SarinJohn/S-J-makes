We know agriculture is the backbone of our country, but Kerala is becoming a consumerist state. When we look why people leaving agriculture behind we can understand one reason as the unavailability of high yield variety of crop seeds and high yield variety of animal breeds. This project is a website. Using this farmerâ€™s info, farmers / user can post the information about the crops and animal breeds which is approved by the admin after verifying it. The admin can be agriculture officer or veterinary doctor. This provides the genuinity in the details provided by the farmers. All the registered farmers can view this posts including the details of agriculture items and personal details. The entered post can be rejected by admin if fake. Thus farmer can select from wide variety of genuine items which may increase their yield. This in another way act as a medium for marketing too. This also contains information about benefits that the farmers can get from the government, information regarding the classes given for the farmers.  This project is designed in three modules: admin, user and public.
